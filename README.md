# A Burrowsâ€“Wheeler transform implementation

This is a Java implementation of [BWT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrows%E2%80%93Wheeler_transform ). The implementation follows the description given in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n7NPk5lwbI) video. The encoding and decoding logic requires a "terminator" character which must be the last character in the input for encoding such that it's value is less then all other characters in the input. By default this is `\u0000`.  For example `SIX.MIXED.PIXIES.SIFT.SIXTY.PIXIE.DUST.BOXES` will encode to `TEXYDST.E.IXIXIXXSSMPPS.B..E.\u0000.EUSFXDIIOIIIT`
Alternatively, a custom terminator can be specified which is useful for testing, the `$` character is a good choice as it has a low numeric value and is easily recognizable, e.g: `abaaba$` encodes to `abba$aa`

### Comments
* The implementation is using the suffix aray approach for encoding 
* Thread safe (Encoder and Decoder are stateless)
* Reasonably efficient
* The tests in test/ directory demonstrate the basic usage
